I did this project on the suggestion of my dad. He always thought that this would be a fun project to do. I assumed that 
each person did not shuffle when they took a trick, but rather that they put any cards they won on the bottem of their deck.
I also assumed that if there was a war, they would put down an additional 2 cards and play the next one to determine who wins the war. If
they cannot put down two cards, they put down as many as they can and still flip up a card.
